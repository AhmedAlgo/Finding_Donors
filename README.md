## This is a Supervised Machine Learning Models Project. 

### I build an algorithm to best identify potential donors. 
### The goal was to evaluate and optimize several different supervised machine learning models to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent to potential doners.
